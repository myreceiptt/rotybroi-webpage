## Maintenance by Prof. NOTA Evergreen Standard

This repository is intentionally **frozen** and designed to remain evergreen
while staying production-safe.

No build system, package manager, or runtime dependency is used by design.

### Runtime

- Runtime: **None (static HTML / CSS / Vanilla JS)**
- Build step: **None**
- Package manager: **None**
- Dependency model:
  - External scripts via CDN only (documented and pinned)
- Deploy target:
  - **Vercel (static hosting)**
  - ~~Netlify~~
  - ~~Self-hosted / Docker~~
  - ~~Other platform~~

### Asset & Cache Policy (Frozen)

- All JS and CSS files are **content-hashed**
- Static assets are served with:
  - `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- HTML files are served with revalidation enabled
- No further JS/CSS changes are expected

### Maintenance Policy

There are **no routine dependency updates**.

Recommended periodic checks (manual, optional):

1. Verify deployment health:
   - No 404 errors
   - No mixed-content warnings
2. Verify headers:
   - Cache-Control
   - Security headers (nosniff, referrer-policy, etc.)
3. Verify external services:
   - Analytics IDs still active
   - CDN links still valid

### Change Policy

- JS/CSS changes: **Not allowed**
- Asset updates: **Not allowed**
- Content updates:
  - HTML-only
  - Must not introduce new runtime dependencies

Any future functional change must be done in a **new repository or versioned successor**.
